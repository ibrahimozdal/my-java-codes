/*
   Parent-Child Classes Relations (Inheritance)
   1) Public class members can be used in child class
   2) Protected class members can be used in child class
   3) Default class members can be used in child class'
      Parent-Child classes must be in the same package
   4) Private class members can't be used in child class  
   5) Static class members should be accessed by child class name 
   6) Java does not support multiple inheritance,
      A class can have only one parent class
   7) super() is parent constructor call
   8) super() must be in the first line in every constructor
   9) this() must be in the first line as well,
      we can not use this() and super() in the same constructor
